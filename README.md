# AB-Testing-Project

## Business Problem

* Facebook recently introduced a new type of bidding, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding.
*
* One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to run an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding.
